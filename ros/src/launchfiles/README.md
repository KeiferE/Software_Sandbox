# Launchfiles

There are 2 types of launchfiles that we use. Strictly speaking they do the same thing, but we use them in a hierarchical fashion to organize things.

# Local Launchfile

The local launchfile is reponsible for providing a package with default parameters. They are there so that in the event that we want to test the whole system, we do not need to know all the parameters required for every node to function properly, we can simply call upon the local launchfile and it will handle the rest. An example of a launchfile can be found [here](/ros/launchfiles/launchfiles/local.launch).
