# Graphical User Interface

A GUI is very useful when it comes to collecting, reading and filtering data as it comes in (when the sub is operational). 
It will allow us to operate the sub manually without having multiple terminal windows open.

## Which software library should we use?

There are 2 popular open-source frameworks in linux available to us, Qt (pronounced cute) and GTK. GTK is what is used in most Linux distributions. Qt however is much easier to develop with and is provided as a ROS package, so that is what we are going with.
