# Computer Vision

The use of computer vision is the biggest factors in determining what place AUVic will finish at Robosub. Virtually all of the other systems onboard the submarine will depend on how well our image analysis is able to provide them with their data.

## What library do we use?

OpenCV is the most commonly used open-source framework for computer vision. It also comes packaged with ROS and works well in embedded environments.
