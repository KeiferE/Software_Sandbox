# Welcome to the Software Sandbox

The purpose of this repository is to provide a sandbox for testing out the different frameworks,
libraries and algorithms used by AUVic.

## How to get started

1. [Setup your Linux environment](https://github.com/uvic-auvic/Software_Sandbox/wiki/Setting-up-your-environment)
2. [Learn the basic git commands we will be using](https://github.com/uvic-auvic/Software_Sandbox/wiki/Git-Workflow)
3. Clone this repository (by following the instructions in the above step)
4. Go through any of the below areas of interest which will introduce you to the various libraries we use. This is by no means a comprehensive tutorial but will hopefully give you a bit of an idea in how to make use of it and where to find more information.

## Areas of Interest

- [ROS](ros/src)
- [OpenCV](vision/)
- [Qt](qt/)
- [Gazebo](gazebo/)
- [Linux](linux/)
- [System Tests](system_tests/)
