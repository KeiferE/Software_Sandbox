# AUVIC Software Challenges

Hello!

A lot of you have been asking for challenges to practice with some of the frameworks we work with here at AUVIC. 
In this directory you will find folders with challenges posted. Generally challenges will tie into some tutorial done at a software meeting 
but, can be done without going to any still! Each challenge will give you some files/information to help you out and give you somewhere to start, 
along with a goal. If you can, try to not look at other solutions on our repo's unless you are really stuck, treat it like you are working 
a new problem! If you have any questions or need help please contact Anu or Keifer for help or information. 

## You finished your solution, what now?

Congratulations!

Set up a time to show us your code running and we can sit down and do a code review. During the review we will talk about your methodology
you used, challenges you faced, any improvements, and any questions you may have.
