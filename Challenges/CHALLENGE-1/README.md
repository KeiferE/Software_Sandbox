# Challenge #1

Hello and welcome to challenge #1

***Supplied files will be added after the tutorial associated with the challenge is completed. If you want to start before hand feel free or you can wait.***

In this folder you will find:

- a ‘src’ folder containing:
  - two ros nodes
- an mp4 file 
- frames from the mp4 video
- package.xml file
- CMakeLists.txt file
- a ‘launch’ folder

## Goals:

- take the published video camera node output, and in the node that subscribes to the associated topic perform vision detection on the orange buoy as best as possible. This node then publishes an (x,y) coordinate and any other information you deem important.

- modify the package.xml and CMakelists.txt files if necessary to compile your files in your catkin workspace. 

- add a launch file that starts the two nodes
	- have the launch file pass in params to the nodes on launch

## After your done

Set up a time for  a code review with Anu or Keifer

***Can be done in groups, or alone. But try not to use any solutions on our repo, try to treat it like a new problem! If you have any questions you can ask Anu or Keifer.***
